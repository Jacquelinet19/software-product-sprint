      <h2>About Me</h2>
       <img src="/images/profilepic.jpg" style="width:300px;height:400x;"/>
      <p>My name is Jacqueline Tapia but I also go by Jackie. 
          I'm a second year student majoring in Computer Science
          with a minor in Mathematics and a minor in Data Science
          at Southern Connecticut State University. I'm a first
          generation Mexican-American college student. Some of my 
          involvements on campus include being co-secretary for the
          Computer Science Club and working at the Academic Success
          Center as a tutor and success coach. 
      </p>

      <p>I'm really passionate about education, the ennvironemnt
          and diversity in tech. 
      </p>

      <p> I have always loved helping people in anyway that I can. I started volunteering at food pantries,
          convalescent homes, classrooms, and other places at a very young age. Whenever I see something wrong or
          something missing I always want to try and make it better or fix it if I can. That's how I knew that
          whatever career or field I went into, I had to be making an impact for the better in someone's life. That's
          why I really like programming. I have the ability to build tools that hopefully make the lives of others
          easier or help them in some form.
      </p>

      <h2>My Projects</h2>
      <p>Most of these projects are not passion projects but I think they taught me very important programming
          fundamentals so that moving forward I can create more meaningful things
      </p>
      <p>Geometric Shapes</p>
      <p>This project was created in Java with object oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, and 
          inheritance. Ths program allowed the user to create a variety of 2D or 3D objects using GUI by drawing the 
          object in real time. It also displayed information about the shape such as the length, width, height, and volume
          and area, if applicable. 
      </p>

      <p>Sorting Algorithms</p>
      <p>This project utilized Python to test the effeciency of selection, bubble, tree, and merge sorting algorithms. 
          It was done by allowing the algorithms to run on a set of data and incrementing the size of the data by 10,000
          until the algorthim's runtime reached 60 seconds or more. 
      </p>

      <p>Amusemant Park</p>
      <p>This was a Java project to create a carnival/amusement park simulator that allowed the user to learn
         about carnival rides, buy tickets for each ride, and spend tickets on each ride through the console log. Object 
        oriented programming concepts like inheritance, objectsm and classes were utilized.</p>
